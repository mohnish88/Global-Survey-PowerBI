Global Survey of Data Professionals using Power BI

This project involves developing interactive dashboards to visualize the results and key metrics of a global survey of data professionals.
By leveraging Power BI's robust data visualization capabilities, we aim to provide insightful and dynamic representations of the survey data. 
The project includes data collection, cleaning, and transformation processes, followed by the creation of dashboards that highlight trends, 
patterns, and key findings from the survey. The goal is to offer a comprehensive overview of the data professionals' landscape, including demographics, 
skills, tools, and industry trends, to inform decision-making and strategic planning.
